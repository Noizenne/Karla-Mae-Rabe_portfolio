            <p>Karla Mae Rabe is her full name and she is a web developer student at Noroff School of Technology & Digital Media in Norway. She has been studying there part-time now for 2 years. 
                She hasn't much experience yet, but is eager to learn. She is now learning JavaScript.

                <br><br>

               She started having an interest in the field before entering high school, but backed off beacause she was intimidated by the gender distribution. So she went for a vocational subject
               and went to work in kindergarten for 2/3 years. She then went saw an article about girls in technology and decided she wanted to try and here we are... 

               <br><br>

               Karla Mae likes to spend her free time playing online games, watch anime and spending time with her friends and family whenever she doesn't study or code.
