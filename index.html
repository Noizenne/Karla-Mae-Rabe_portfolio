            <p>Karla Mae Rabe is her full name and she is a web developer student at Noroff School of Technology & Digital Media in Norway. She has been studying there part-time now for 2 years. 
                She hasn't much experience yet, but is eager to learn. She is now learning JavaScript.

                <br><br>

               She started having an interest in the field before entering high school, but backed off beacause she was intimidated by the gender distribution. So she went for a vocational subject
               and went to work in kindergarten for 2/3 years. She then went saw an article about girls in technology and decided she wanted to try and here we are...

               Karla Mae likes to spend her free time playing online games, watch anime and spending time with her friends and family whenever she doesn't study or code.
